# Vue.js examples

A collection of code examples for Vue.js and Nuxt.js. Each subfolder contains a Nuxt.js project demonstrating a feature/example.

## How to use it

You can access each project (from a subfolder) on my [CodeSandbox page](https://codesandbox.io/u/ZeanQin). Alternatively, you can checkout each subfolder and build it yourself.

## How to create a new example project

1. Duplicate the `template` folder and change the name of duplicated folder
2. Rename the project by changing the `name` field in the `package.json` file
3. Add Nuxt.js as dependency by running `npm install nuxt`
4. Start the project by running `npm run dev`
